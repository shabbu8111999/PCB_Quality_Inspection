# 🧾 Assignment 2: Automated Quality Inspection System for Manufacturing

## 📌 Project Title
PCB Defect Detection using Computer Vision

---

## 📖 Background
In manufacturing industries, products must be inspected for defects before packaging.  
Manual inspection is slow and can lead to human errors.  
This project demonstrates an automated visual inspection system using computer vision to detect defects on Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs).

---

## 🎯 Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a computer vision solution that:

- Analyzes PCB images  
- Detects and localizes defect regions  
- Classifies defect types with confidence scores  
- Outputs defect center coordinates and defect severity  

---

## 🧩 Chosen Manufactured Item
**Printed Circuit Board (PCB)**  

PCBs are chosen because:
- They have clear visual patterns  
- Defects are visible and well-defined  
- They are widely used in real manufacturing industries  

---

## 🐞 Defect Types Used
The dataset contains the following six PCB defect types:

1. Mouse Bite  
2. Spur  
3. Missing Hole  
4. Short Circuit  
5. Open Circuit  
6. Spurious Copper  

This satisfies the requirement of using at least three different defect types.

## ✅ Conclusion
This project demonstrates how computer vision can be applied to automate PCB quality inspection.  
The system helps improve accuracy, reduce inspection time, and minimize human error in manufacturing processes.
